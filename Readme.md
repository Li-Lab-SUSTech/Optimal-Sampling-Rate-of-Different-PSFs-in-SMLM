# Requirements
Matlab R2019a or newer  

The code runs on macOS and Microsoft Windows 7 or newer, 64-bit

128G RAM

# How to run
These three catalogs corresponds to 4Pi PSF demo, Astigmatic & Tetrapod PSF demo and Double-Helix PSF demo.

Data of 4Pi PSF can be downloaded from [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67769465/200457603-cc37c13e-109e-4289-981e-fd0e172fd83f.png)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8340047).

Example codes are available in the file ***test1.m*** in each demo 

For other PSFs, if you have the zenike coefficients, use Astigmatic & Tetrapod PSF demo, add or replace the coefficients in ***PSF_generate.m***

If you have the pupil function of PSF, use Double-Helix PSF demo, add or replace the phase file.
